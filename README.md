# sqlalchemy-challenge

This is a 2 part exercise in running sql queries and displaying them to an API. The SQLAlchemy toolkit is used to query the data, and Flask is used as our API envrionment.

The backend portion was crafted in climate_starter.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook, and eventually applied to the Flask code in app.py.

The most interesting part of this exercise was in working to pass user params through our api and parse the dates appropriately in order to return accurate results.
